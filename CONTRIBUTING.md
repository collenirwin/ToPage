# Contributing to ToPage

Hi, thank you so much for your interest in `ToPage`! This is a very tiny project. There aren't really and hard-and-fast rules, other than the following:
 - Before you open a pull request, please open an issue (or at least a discussion post) about the feature or fix you are addressing.
 - Please be kind. (see [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))

If you have any questions, or would like to report a bug, please don't hesitate to open an issue or post in the Discussions section.

Again, thank you for your interest!
